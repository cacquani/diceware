# Diceware

Small fun project to (re)learn c and make.

[Diceware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware) generators are usually
limited to one language/dictionary.

The plan is to build a simple generator that will allow polyglot users to
generate passphrases from a mix of dictionaries of their choice.

The lists of words will come from
[here](https://theworld.com/~reinhold/diceware.html).

For the first draft, it will just be Latin alphabet, no accented characters,
and likely a common subset of symbols.
